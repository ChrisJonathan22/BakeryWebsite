        <h4 id="homepage-content">BakersBake can trace its roots back all the way to the late 90s when our daring
            founder took inspiration from his visit to the 1998 world cup. Having chomped his way through the splendid
            goods at a Parisian patisserie, he decided it was time to bring the nation’s baking up to scratch. And so
            began the BakersBake journey… please join us on a trip down memory lane.</h4>

                that

                hand-made artisan baking was the start of a British baking revolution. Visit 202 Upper Street today, and
